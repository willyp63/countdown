# Countdown Timer

### Time Spent
an hour and a half

### Why I Chose the Tools I Did
I chose to use only the essential tools (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I did not feel it was necessary to use any other tools.

### Bugs / Improvements
There are no bugs that I am aware of. If I had more time to make improvements to the code, I would separate the display logic from the time-calculating logic within my JavaScript. I would split the code into two files and bundle them with webpack.
